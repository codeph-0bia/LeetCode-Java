# [Valid Anagram][title]

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **_Anagram_** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false


```

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 \* 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
